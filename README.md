# BE_SmartHack: Shuri

### Description
Chatbot that acts as a personal assistant that allows users to (1) handle issues that come up while at the airport and resolve them by themselves, 
and (2) request services and information while in flight.

## Getting Started
The app is designed to allow users to make requests, ask questions, and file complaints with Shuri, the virtual assistant chatbot. Shuri will relay necessary information
to the user, and redirect them to other features outside of the app, such as their plane ticket via the American Airlines app.

### Features
* Order food and drink in-flight; products will be delivered directly to seat
* Call for transportation (shuttle, taxi, Uber, Lyft)
* Check local public transportation routes and availability (for buses, trains, and subways)
* File a complaint about passenger or any issue that occurs while in-flight
* Review safety guidelines while onboard
* Review basic flight information (plane ticket information)
* Give information about ETAs of boarding, take off, landing, flights, and time to wait at gates
* Check status of bathroom in-flight
* Pre-order food while in terminal; products can be picked up or hand-delivered
* Guidance on items that can be brought on plane (e.g., "Shuri, can I bring this water bottle on the plane?")
* Personal companion for first-time and/or nervous flyers
* Boarding groups

### Tech Stack
* IBM Watson Chatbot: provides functionality for Shuri
* Dynatrace: tracks user engagement with Shuri
* Teradata: American Airlines flight data
* Mastercard: pay for goods bought in terminal and onboard; ID Assist
* Ntelicor
